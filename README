Gold Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview

 This project predicts gold prices (GLD) using historical financial data and machine learning.
 It studies how silver prices (SLV), crude oil prices (USO), and stock market trends (SPX) influence gold prices.

Dataset

 Records: 2,290
 Type: Financial market data
 Target Variable: Gold Price (GLD)

 Key Features:
• SLV – Silver Price
• USO – Crude Oil Price Proxy
• SPX – S&P 500 Index
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 Histograms to analyze feature distributions
 Correlation heatmap to study relationships
 Scatter plots (Gold vs Silver, Gold vs USO) to explore patterns
 Boxplots to detect extreme values

 Key Insights:
• Strong positive relationship between gold and silver prices
• Weak, non-linear relationship between gold and crude oil prices
• Outliers present, requiring preprocessing
Data Preprocessing

 Outlier detection using the IQR method
 Outlier treatment through capping to control extreme values
 Feature scaling applied where required
 Machine Learning Models

 Logistic Regression – baseline linear model
 Random Forest Regressor – non-linear tree-based model

 Results & Findings

 Random Forest achieved strong predictive performance (R² ≈ 0.99)
 Predicted vs actual plots showed stable and consistent predictions
 Tree-based models captured non-linear relationships better than linear models

 Tools Used

 Python
 Pandas, NumPy
 Matplotlib, Seaborn
 Scikit-learn
 Jupyter Notebook
